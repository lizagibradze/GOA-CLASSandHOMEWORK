<p class="pe">Seahorses are small, fascinating marine fish belonging to the genus Hippocampus, a name derived from the Greek words "hippos" (horse) and "kampos" (sea monster). These creatures are easily recognizable by their horse-like head, prehensile tail, and bony, armored bodies. Unlike most fish, seahorses swim upright and rely on small dorsal fins for propulsion, while their pectoral fins help with steering.

    Seahorses inhabit shallow coastal waters, seagrass beds, and coral reefs, where their unique body shape and ability to change color provide excellent camouflage. They are slow swimmers, which makes them vulnerable to predators, but their clever mimicry helps them evade threats.</p>

    




<p class="pe2">One of the most extraordinary aspects of seahorse biology is their reproductive process. Male seahorses carry the eggs in a specialized pouch on their abdomen until they hatch, a rare example of male pregnancy in the animal kingdom. This process can result in the birth of hundreds of tiny seahorses at a time.

    Seahorses feed primarily on small crustaceans, using their elongated snouts to suck in prey. They are a symbol of good luck in many cultures, but their populations are under threat due to habitat destruction, climate change, and overharvesting for traditional medicine and the aquarium trade. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these remarkable creatures.</p>
