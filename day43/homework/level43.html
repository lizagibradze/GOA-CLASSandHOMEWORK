<h1>frogs</h1>


<p>
    Frogs are amphibians found worldwide, except in extremely cold regions. They have moist skin, long hind legs for jumping, and webbed feet for swimming. Frogs undergo metamorphosis, starting as eggs, then becoming tadpoles before developing into adults. They are vital to ecosystems, controlling insect populations and serving as food for predators. Some frogs have toxins for defense, like poison dart frogs. Their calls help attract mates and mark territory. Frogs are sensitive to environmental changes, making them important indicators of ecosystem health. Sadly, habitat loss, pollution, and climate change threaten many frog species, leading to population declines worldwide.
