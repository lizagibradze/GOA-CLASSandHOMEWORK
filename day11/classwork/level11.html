        <p>Tigers (Panthera tigris) are the largest wild cats, known for their striking orange fur and black stripes. Native to Asia, they inhabit various environments, including forests, grasslands, and mangroves. Tigers are solitary hunters, primarily preying on deer and wild boar. They play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance as apex predators. Unfortunately, tigers are classified as endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, with populations declining dramatically over the years. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent creatures and their habitats, emphasizing the importance of biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>
