<p>Turtles are reptiles known for their protective shells, which are made of bone and covered in keratin. These creatures have existed for over 200 million years, making them one of the oldest living species. Turtles can live in various habitats, including oceans, rivers, and land. They are ectothermic, relying on the environment to regulate their body temperature. Some, like sea turtles, migrate long distances to nest. Turtles are omnivores, feeding on plants, insects, and small animals. Unfortunately, many species face threats from habitat destruction, pollution, and poaching. Conservation efforts aim to protect these fascinating animals for future generations.</p>
