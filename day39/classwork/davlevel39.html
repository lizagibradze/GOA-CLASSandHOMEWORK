<p>Hedgehogs are small, nocturnal mammals known for their spiny coats, which provide protection against predators. Belonging to the Erinaceidae family, they have short legs and a pointed snout, typically measuring 5 to 12 inches in length. Found across Europe, Asia, and Africa, hedgehogs are mainly insectivores, feeding on insects, worms, and small invertebrates. They are solitary creatures and often curl into a ball when threatened, using their spines as a defense mechanism. Hedgehogs are popular pets due to their low-maintenance nature, but they require specific care, including a balanced diet and a safe, warm environment.</p>
