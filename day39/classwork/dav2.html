<p class="taa-1">The <span class="highlight">axolotls</span>, also known as the Mexican walking fish, is a unique species of salamander (Ambystoma mexicanum) native to lakes near Mexico City. Unlike most amphibians,<span class="highlight">axolotls</span> retain their juvenile features throughout their life, a trait known as neoteny. They are famous for their ability to <span class="highlight">regenerate lost limbs</span> , organs, and even parts of their <span class="highlight">brain</span>  , making them a subject of scientific study. These aquatic creatures have feathery external gills, allowing them to breathe underwater. <span class="highlight">Axolotls</span>  are critically endangered in the wild due to habitat loss and pollution, though they are commonly bred in captivity for research and as <span class="highlight">pets</span>.</p>
