 <p>The lion, known as the "king of the jungle," is one of the most iconic and powerful animals in the world. Native to Africa and parts of Asia, lions live in social groups called prides, which consist of related females, their cubs, and a few adult males. Lions are carnivorous and hunt in coordinated groups, targeting large prey like zebras and buffalo. Known for their majestic manes, male lions are easily recognizable. Lions are symbols of strength, courage, and leadership in many cultures. However, their populations are threatened by habitat loss and poaching, making conservation efforts crucial.</p>
