    Lions are majestic big cats known as the "King of the Jungle," though they primarily inhabit grasslands and savannas. Native to Africa and parts of Asia, lions live in social groups called prides, consisting of females, their cubs, and a few males. Male lions are recognizable by their iconic manes, while lionesses are skilled hunters. Lions are apex predators, feeding on prey like zebras and wildebeests. They symbolize strength and courage in various cultures. Unfortunately, habitat loss and poaching threaten their populations, making conservation efforts crucial to their survival. Lions are a vital part of their ecosystems and global heritage.
