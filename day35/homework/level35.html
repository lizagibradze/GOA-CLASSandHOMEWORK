Sharks are cartilaginous fish, belonging to a group known as elasmobranchs, which also includes rays and skates. Found in oceans worldwide, they are renowned for their sharp teeth and streamlined bodies, making them effective predators. Sharks play a vital role in maintaining marine ecosystems by regulating prey populations. Over 500 species exist, ranging from the tiny dwarf lanternshark to the massive whale shark, which feeds on plankton. Despite their fearsome reputation, shark attacks on humans are rare. However, many shark species are endangered due to overfishing and habitat loss, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect these incredible creatures.

    Sharks are ancient creatures, having existed for over 400 million years, even before dinosaurs. They possess remarkable adaptations, such as electroreceptors to detect prey and replaceable teeth. Popular species include great white sharks, tiger sharks, and hammerheads. Sadly, millions are killed annually for their fins, leading to critical population declines worldwide.
